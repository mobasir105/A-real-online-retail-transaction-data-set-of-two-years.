The `online_retail_II.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file is an analysis of the "Online Retail II" dataset. Here is a brief overview of its structure and contents:

1. **Imports**: The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, and setting display options for better readability.

2. **Data Loading**: It loads the dataset from an Excel file (`online_retail_II.xlsx`) and displays the first few rows using `df.head()`.

3. **Data Information**: It provides a summary of the dataset using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`, showing data types, non-null counts, and basic statistics.

4. **Data Cleaning**: The notebook identifies and displays rows with missing `Customer ID` values and negative `Quantity` values.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook likely includes further analysis and visualizations to understand the data better, although not all cells are shown in the snippet.
